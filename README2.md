# Go REST Example üòõ

Now that we aren't on the frontpage, I can finally be myself and use dumb emojis everywhere!!!
(This is kinda outdated, TODO update)

## So, understanding the Requests Lifecycle ‚Ü©Ô∏è

**This is a big project**. If you dive in head-first without much knowledge you'll probably find your way around, but keep on reading just a little bit and you'll be able to really own this.


### First, a quick overview ‚ö°

- `Server starts`. Router starts receiving HTTP Requests, mapping them to the corresponding Endpoint.

- `HTTP Requests` are transformed into our custom Requests, for example `CreateUserRequest` (with fields like Username or Password). Those requests are validated.

- Our Request is transformed into a `Model`, the key structures of our program. They're our DB Schema and also where we perform operations. A `UserModel`, for example, has methods like .Create or .Update, taking the `Repository` as parameter to communicate with the DB.

- A `CreateUserResponse` is generated with the operations' results, and finally transformed into an `HTTP Response`.

**`HTTP Request ‚û°Ô∏è CreateUserRequest ‚û°Ô∏è UserModel ‚û°Ô∏è Repository ‚û°Ô∏è Database ‚û°Ô∏è CreateUserResponse ‚û°Ô∏è HTTP Response`**

### Then, a not so quick one üêå

- `You start the server`. All of its modules are also initialized and if there are no errors, the server will run. 

- A `Router` will be in place listening for any wandering HTTP Request that happens to fall beneath its path. Oh wow! A new `HTTP Request` came in, and it's pointed towards the Create User Endpoint. It'll run the `Middleware` and send it on its way.

- The HTTP Request's data is used to create our own custom `CreateUserRequest` (with fields like Username or Password). Validations are executed here.

- If validations pass, that CreateUserRequest will be passed along the way and eventually converted into a `Model`, in this case a `UserModel`.

- **Models are the key players of our app, they define the DB Schema and also serve as Business Objects**, which means that much of the logic of the program will be inside of the methods of this UserModel. 

- Methods like `.Create` or `.Update` are called, which take the `Repository` as parameter and use it to talk to the `Database`. Also methods like HashPassword that just modify fields inside of the Model.

- The UserModel is filled with the resulting data, and then transformed into a `CreateUserResponse`. Middleware executes again, and our custom Response is transformed into a beautiful `HTTP Response`.

**`HTTP Request ‚û°Ô∏è Middleware ‚û°Ô∏è CreateUserRequest ‚û°Ô∏è Validations ‚û°Ô∏è UserModel ‚û°Ô∏è Repository ‚û°Ô∏è Database ‚û°Ô∏è CreateUserResponse ‚û°Ô∏è Middleware HTTP ‚û°Ô∏è Response`**


### `Easy. As. Fvck. ü¶Ü`

## What about the Architecture? üè†

**`3 Layers:`**

### Transport

- Starts with the Middleware, on `prometheus.go`.
- If the endpoint is private, it goes through `token_validation.go`.
- Goes then through the Endpoint, on `endpoints.go`
- The `handler.go` is called which controls the request's lifecycle.
- Our Custom Request is built and validated on `requests_builders.go` and `requests_validations.go`.
- The handler then calls the `service_xxx.go` file.

### Service

- The Request is transformed into a Model, in `requests_to_models.go`.
- The model's methods are called, on `models_actions_xxx.go`.
- The repository is sometimes passed as parameter, calling the methods on `repository_xxx.go`.

### Repository

- The methods on `repository_xxx.go` call the database and return the operation's result.

### Service

- The Model is transformed into a Response Model, and the Response is passed back to the handler.

### Transport

- Any errors are handled and logged on the `http_errors_mapper.go`.
- The Response is transformed into an HTTP Request and returned to the client.
